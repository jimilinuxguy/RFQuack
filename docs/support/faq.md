title: F.A.Q.

## How do I solve build errors?

RFQuack's build system is heavily based on PlatformIO. If you're getting build errors, it's very likely that you'll be able to get some hints on how to solve them in the [PlatformIO documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/) or [support forum](https://community.platformio.org/).

## How do I get support?

RFQuack is an open-source project and support is through its community. A great place to start is our [Community](community.md) page.

## How do I report a bug or security vulnerability?

First of all, thanks! If you found a bug or security vulnerability, reporting it is the most responsible thing you could do and a great form of contribution for the community. This said, please [file an issue choosing the appropriate type](https://github.com/rfquack/RFQuack/issues/new/choose).

## How do I request a new feature?

Although the development of this project is mostly following an irregular schedule due to its pro-bono nature, we're happy to receive suggestions on new features. This said, please [file an issue choosing the appropriate type](https://github.com/rfquack/RFQuack/issues/new/choose).

## Why is F.A.Q. list is so short?

Because we're newborn! ðŸ˜œ
